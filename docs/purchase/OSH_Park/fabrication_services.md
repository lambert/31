# OSH Park Fabrication Services.

[OSH Park](https://www.oshpark.com/) is a community printed circuit board (PCB) order that brings
you high quality, lead-free boards which are manufactured in the United
States and shipped for free to anywhere in the world.

We offer purple soldermask over bare copper (SMOBC) and an ENIG
(Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold) finish.

Full stackups and design rules are linked under Services below.

Please email us at [support@oshpark.com](mailto://support@oshpark.com) with questions!

### 2 Layer Prototype Service.

Our famous 2 layer purple prototype production.

#### Pricing.

$5 per square inch, which includes three copies of your design.

For example, a 2 square inch board would cost $10 and you’d get three
copies of your board.

You can order as many copies as you want, as long as they’re in
multiples of three.

#### Turn Times.

Orders are sent to fabrication daily, and will ship within 12 days.

95% of our 2 layer orders ship in 8 days.

You can get a quote, approve a design, and pay for an order at OSH Park.

### 1 Layer Prototype Service.

While we cannot fabricate true single-layer boards, we support single
layer designs on our 2 layer fabrication service.

The cost, stackup, specs, and turn time are identical to that of the 2
layer service.

#### Ordering.

Our automated upload service expects all files to contain gerber data
for a 2 layer design.

This often results in errors when trying to place an order.

In many cases, this issue can be resolved by configuring the design tool
to output data for a 2 layer design.

If only the manufacturing files are available, this usually requires a
few files to be copied and modified.

Our Uploading 1 layer boards page has a guide on doing this.

#### Pricing.

$5 per square inch, which includes three copies of your design.

For example, a 2 square inch board would cost $10 and you’d get three
copies of your board.

You can order as many copies as you want, as long as they’re in
multiples of three.

#### Turn Times.

Orders are sent to fabrication daily, and will ship within 10-12 days.

You can get a quote, approve a design, and pay for an order at OSH Park.

For a faster turn time, you may be interested in our Super Swift Service.

[FR408 High Performance Laminate and Prepreg Data Sheet](FR408-High-Performance-Laminate-and-Prepreg-Data-Sheet.pdf)

#### Layer Naming.

When sent to fabrication, the layers are manufactured in the following
order according to their file extension.

We advise following this naming scheme if your design is sensitive to
distance of the inner planes in order to avoid any confusion.

Layer   | Suggested File Extension | Description          |
--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
Layer 1 | .GTL                     | Top or Front layer   |
Layer 2 | .G2L                     | Internal Plane       |
Layer 3 | .G3L                     | Internal Plane       |
Layer 4 | .GBL                     | Bottom or Back layer |

#### Internal Plane Polarity.

When submitting gerbers, we need the “positive” internal planes, meaning
that lines represent copper, not the absence of copper.

Some CAD tools will generate the internal planes as power planes with
“negative” polarity so the lines indicate where copper should be removed.

To work around this, declare the internal planes as signal layers and
use a copper pour to define the power plane.

Take a look at our Positive and Negative Gerbers page for more
information.

#### 4 Layer Drill Specs.

Spec                         | Size    |
-----------------------------|---------|
Minimum annular ring         |   4 mil |
Minimum hole size            |  10 mil |
Maximum plated hole size     | 260 mil |
Maximum non-plated hole size | none    |
Via plating thickness        |   1 mil |
Blind Vias                   | No      |
Buried Vias                  | No      |

#### Internal Plane Polarity.

When submitting gerbers, we need the “positive” internal planes, meaning
that lines represent copper, not the absence of copper.

Some CAD tools will generate the internal planes as power planes with
“negative” polarity so the lines indicate where copper should be removed.

To work around this, declare the internal planes as signal layers and
use a copper pour to define the power plane.

Take a look at our Positive and Negative Gerbers page for more
information.
